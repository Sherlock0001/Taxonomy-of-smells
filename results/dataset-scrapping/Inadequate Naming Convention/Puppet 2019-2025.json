This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

This is bad because the two\nimplementations are all jumbled up inside of one another and behavior\nmay become unpredictable.  Warnings are also displayed directly to the\nend user in the form of redefined constants.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by renaming Puppet::Module::Tool inside of\nPuppet to Puppet::ModuleTool  This fixes the problem because Puppet will\nno longer monkey-patch the Puppet::Module::Tool module inside of the\npuppet-module Gem.\n\nThis patch also has the added benefit of making the Module's name match\nup with the CamelCase filepath (puppet/module_tool/ =>\nPuppet::ModuleTool)  As a result, no file moves are necessary.",

Here the old implementation\nsimply returned undef because there is no way the language could find\na variable starting with '$' (the internal APIs are always without '$').\n\nThe tests are updated so that on Puppet 6.0.0 and later, it tests a\ndefault value, and test for bad variable specification is changed to\nsimply test for a not found variable.

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",

It then\nused constant file names within the temp directory to re-write the\nfiles in ruby's bin directory, and bat wrappers on Windows.\n\nFirst, it leads to predictable temp file names, which is bad. Second,\nwhen installing puppet via a non-interactive ssh shell, e.g.\n\n  ssh <host> ruby install.rb\n\nwhich is what the acceptance test harness does, the TMP and TEMP\nenvironment variables are usually not defined. So puppet was always\ndefaulting to /tmp, which doesn't work when installing puppet on\nWindows agents during acceptance tests.\n\nThis commit just changes the install script to use ruby's Tempfile to\ngenerate secure temp files that works in non-interactive shells.",

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",

Here the old implementation\nsimply returned undef because there is no way the language could find\na variable starting with '$' (the internal APIs are always without '$').\n\nThe tests are updated so that on Puppet 6.0.0 and later, it tests a\ndefault value, and test for bad variable specification is changed to\nsimply test for a not found variable. (The real tests for the function\nin puppet already tests that it raises an error for faulty variable).",

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",

Since we\nthen load the Puppet::Node back in using YAML, and YAML uses the magic\nof type annotations to re-create the Puppet::Node instance, the\nenvironment that ends up being set on the Puppet::Node instance isn't\nan instance of Puppet::Node::Environment, but is a String.\n\nSince the Puppet::Node doesn't get a callback during deserialization, we\nadded a fixup method to the Puppet::Indirector::YAML implementation so\nthat the node object can be fixed up before being handed out to the big,\nbad world.\n\nThe other choice was to use safe_yaml to load the file and then do the\nconversion, but safe_yaml is significantly slower than just plain yaml\nand we decided to avoid the performance hit.",
