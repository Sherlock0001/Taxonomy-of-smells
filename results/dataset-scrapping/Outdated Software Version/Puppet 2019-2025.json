We were explicitly\n    testing the hostgroup membership for the former, so replace that\n    with a couple of new ones which should provide more stable coverage\n    going forward.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ida28b65e9f1dc01f233cc9bff4ce32aef70e347a\n    \n  - Use regexes for servers in global site manifest\n    \n    In preparation for rebuilding many openstack.org servers in the\n    opendev.org domain and generally supporting server names with\n    ordinal suffixes, switch them to regular expression matches in the\n    global site manifest.\n    \n    Change-Id: I29c7f5dce90d25ec735fc6a841dbd18f51b0b6f3\n    \n  - Remove deleted review and puppetmaster servers\n    \n    Remove the Ansible inventory and Puppet global site manifest entries\n    for the old review.openstack.org and puppetmaster.openstack.org\n    servers.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.

Unfortauntely this then means we fail to get this data which\n    could be cached if we can't talk to the backend for some reason.\n    \n    By default pypi seems to set a 600 second max-age on these indexes which\n    should be far better than not caching at all. So set the config to have\n    apache ignore client side max-age and other cache disabling directives.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2da7006dcd8a8f4212f5e766ef35ba7b98177ed0\n    \n  - Merge \"Enable ARA reports for system-config bridge CI jobs\"\n  - Merge \"Add support for enabling the ARA callback plugin in install-ansible\"\n  - Merge \"Prefix install_openstacksdk variable\"\n  - Merge \"Turn on the future parser for lists.openstack.org\"\n  - Merge \"Add a script to generate the static inventory\"\n  - Merge \"Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\"\n  - Merge \"Mirror Stein on Ubuntu from Cloud Archive\"\n  - Enable github shared admin account\n    \n    This change describes the shared github administrator account.\n    \n    This is inspired by I0c61f192a6b5164af7babde5c99e5ee2b77a652c.  As\n    described there, this allows for admins to have private accounts in\n    the organisation, but requires that 2FA be turned on.  If people wish\n    to keep this as a single account which they do \"real\" work with\n    (commits, etc) that is probably OK, but add a note that you'll end up\n    with a lot of mostly irrelevant stuff in your feeds.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic408250571133796b4b4639715fe8d01f91898f2\n    \n  - Add a script to generate the static inventory\n    \n    We moved from dynamic to static inventory. When creating a new host with\n    launch-node, a script isn't really needed, the inventory is yaml, the\n    new host can just be added. However, generating a new inventory by\n    hitting the APIs of all of our clouds might be useful, so add a utility\n    script to help in case such a thing is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae1be8e9cfe19533005e9f0395d1ef7a6427bc83\n    \n  - Merge \"Configure packages on ubuntu arm servers\"\n  - Merge \"Don't install lxd on our servers\"\n  - Ectomy some Jenkins out of the docs\n    \n    There are a bunch of places where the narrative text say things like\n    \"jenkins runs jobs\". This hasn't been true for a while and it's getting\n    less true.\n    \n    Left third-party and running-your-own alone because those are\n    instructions for other people to do things - and we are not yet at the\n    point where we are suggesting anyone do their things like we do our\n    things.\n    \n    The devstack-gate document describes an old deprecated system, but the\n    system is still in use (sadly) so it was mostly left intact. A warning\n    was added so that people would be clear that it was deprecated.\n    \n    Also removed the logstash client config file. It's the only change in\n    here that actually affects running code and became unnecessary when it\n    was switched to geard with Ie3f814e6d3278d87f2a20a72e40b6b92217684fc\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf2128c3f953976180c71cb599fcbff7bc06c28a\n    \n  - Merge \"Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\"\n  - Merge \"fix somes typos in doc file.\"\n  - Merge \"Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\"\n  - fix somes typos in doc file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a27ddb6fcbcaa21c223d0b76e733063acce4556\n    \n  - Trivial: Update pypi url to new url\n    \n    Pypi url changed from [1] to [2]\n    \n    [1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/<package>\n    [2] https://pypi.org/project/<package>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9f62ed7ed9d9732590d7d274feee64eb41818e9\n    \n  - Merge \"Fix dead link\"\n  - Fix enumerated list in gerrit.rst\n    \n    Remove incorrect whitespace\n    \n    Change-Id: I45203210da5288c14f1f273513b20160add73227\n    Ref: docs.o.o/infra/system-config/gerrit.html#troubleshooting\n    \n  - Fix spelling mistakes and reST typos in the doc\n    \n    Change-Id: I61d9780f3f1937c6e8d326a670c40fb6a931dbce\n    \n  - Run a local MySQL service on StoryBoard servers\n    \n    In preparation to move the SB data out of Trove instances to a local\n    database, make sure the database is created via configuration\n    management.
