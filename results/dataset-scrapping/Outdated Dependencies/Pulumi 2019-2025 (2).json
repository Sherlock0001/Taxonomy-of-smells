For example,\n    -   Before: https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/tree/main/docs\n    -   After: https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/tree/v1.7.1/docs\n- Fix actionlint wrongly reports an error when using `ghcr.io` or\n`docker.io` at `image` field of action metadata file of Docker action\nwithout `docker://` scheme.\n([#&#8203;428](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/428))\n    ```yaml\n    runs:\n      using: 'docker'\n    ```\n\n### This should be OK\n\n    image: 'ghcr.io/user/repo:latest'\n\n<!---->\n\n- Fix checking `preactjs/compressed-size-action@v2` usage caused a false\npositive.\n([#&#8203;422](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/422))\n    - Fix an error message when invalid escaping is found in globs.\n- The design of the [playground\npage](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/) is overhauled following the\nupgrade of bulma package to v1.\n    - Current actionlint version is shown in the heading.\n    - The color theme is changed to the official dark theme.\n- The list of useful links is added to the bottom of the page as\n'Resources' section.\n\n    [Changes][v1.7.1]\n\n###\n[`v1.7.0`](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v170---08-May-2024)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/compare/v1.6.27...v1.7.0)\n\n- From this version, actionlint starts to check action metadata file\n`action.yml` (or `action.yaml`). At this point, only very basic checks\nare implemented and contents of `steps:` are not checked yet.\n- It checks properties under `runs:` section (e.g. `main:` can be\nspecified when it is a JavaScript action), `branding:` properties, and\nso on.\n        ```yaml\n        name: 'My action'\n        author: '...'\n        ```\n\n### ERROR: 'description' section is missing\n\n    branding:\n\n### ERROR: Invalid icon name\n\n      icon: dog\n\n    runs:\n\n### ERROR: Node.js runtime version is too old\n\n      using: 'node12'\n\n### ERROR: The source file being run by this action does not exist\n\n      main: 'this-file-does-not-exist.js'\n\n### ERROR: 'env' configuration is only allowed for Docker actions\n\n      env:\n        SOME_VAR: SOME_VALUE\n    ```\n\n- actionlint still focuses on checking workflow files. So there is no\nway to directly specify `action.yml` as an argument of `actionlint`\ncommand. actionlint checks all local actions which are used by given\nworkflows. If you want to use actionlint for your action development,\nprepare a test/example workflow which uses your action, and check it\nwith actionlint instead.\n- Checks for `steps:` contents are planned to be implemented. Since\nseveral differences are expected between `steps:` in workflow file and\n`steps:` in action metadata file (e.g. available contexts), the\nimplementation is delayed to later version. And the current\nimplementation of action metadata parser is ad hoc. I'm planning a large\nrefactorying and breaking changes Go API around it are expected.\n- Add `runner.environment` property.\n([#&#8203;412](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/412))\n    ```yaml\n    - run: echo 'Run by GitHub-hosted runner'\n      if: runner.environment == 'github-hosted'\n    ```\n- Using outdated popular actions is now detected at error. See [the\ndocument](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/docs/checks.md#detect-outdated-popular-actions)\nfor more details.\n- Here 'outdated' means actions which use runtimes no longer supported\nby GitHub-hosted runners such as `node12`.\n        ```yaml\n        ```\n\n### ERROR: actions/checkout@v2 is using the outdated runner 'node12'\n\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    ```\n\n- Support `attestations` permission which was [recently added to GitHub\nActions as\nbeta](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).\n([#&#8203;418](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/418), thanks\n[@&#8203;bdehamer](https://togithub.com/bdehamer))\n    ```yaml\n    permissions:\n      id-token: write\n      contents: read\n      attestations: write\n    ```\n- Check comparison expressions more strictly. Arbitrary types of\noperands can be compared as [the official\ndocument](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#operators)\nexplains. However, comparisons between some types are actually\nmeaningless because the values are converted to numbers implicitly.\nactionlint catches such meaningless comparisons as errors. Please see\n[the check\ndocument](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/docs/checks.md#check-comparison-types)\nfor more details.\n    ```yaml\n    on:\n      workflow_call:\n        inputs:\n          timeout:\n            type: boolean\n\n    jobs:\n      test:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n          - run: echo 'called!'\n    ```\n\n### ERROR: Comparing string to object is always evaluated to false\n\n          if: ${{ github.event == 'workflow_call' }}\n        - run: echo 'timeout is too long'\n\n### ERROR: Comparing boolean value with `>` doesn't make sense\n\n          if: ${{ inputs.timeout > 60 }}\n\n<!---->\n\n- Follow the update that `macos-latest` is now an alias to `macos-14`\nrunner.\n    - Support a custom python shell by `pyflakes` rule.\n- Add workaround actionlint reports that `dorny/paths-filter`'s\n`predicate-quantifier` input is not defined.\n([#&#8203;416](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/416))\n- Fix the type of a conditional expression by comparison operators is\nwider than expected by implementing type narrowing.\n([#&#8203;384](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/384))\n- For example, the type of following expression should be `number` but\nit was actually `string | number` and actionlint complained that\n`timeout-minutes` must take a number value.\n      ```yaml\n      timeout-minutes: ${{ env.FOO && 10 || 60 }}\n      ```\n- Fix `${{ }}` placeholder is not available at `jobs.<job_id>.services`.\n([#&#8203;402](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/402))\n    ```yaml\n    jobs:\n      test:\n        services: ${{ fromJSON('...') }}\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n          - run: ...\n\n- Do not check outputs of\n`google-github-actions/get-secretmanager-secrets` because this action\nsets outputs dynamically.\n([#&#8203;404](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/404))\n- Fix `defaults.run` is ignored on detecting the shell used in `run:`.\n([#&#8203;409](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/409))\n    ```yaml\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: pwsh\n    jobs:\n      test:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n    ```\n\n### This was wrongly detected as bash script\n\n        - run: $Env:FOO = \"FOO\"\n\n<!---->\n\n- Fix parsing a syntax error reported from pyflakes when checking a\nPython script in `run:`.\n([#&#8203;411](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/411))\n    ```yaml\n    - run: print(\n      shell: python\n\n- Skip checking `exclude:` items in `matrix:` when they are constructed\nfrom `${{ }}` dynamically.\n([#&#8203;414](https://togithub.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/414))\n    ```yaml\n    matrix:\n      foo: ['a', 'b']\n      exclude:\n    ```\n\n### actionlint complained this value didn't exist in matrix combinations\n\n      - foo: ${{ env.EXCLUDE_FOO }}\n\n<!---->\n\n- Fix checking `exclude:` items when `${{ }}` is used in nested arrays\nat matrix items.\n    ```yaml\n    matrix:\n      foo:\n        - [\"${{ fromJSON('...') }}\"]\n      exclude:\n### actionlint complained this value didn't match to any matrix\ncombinations\n        - foo: ['foo']\n\n- Update popular actions data set.
