# 🔬 Automation and Security Experimentation Repository

This repository provides a structured framework for experimenting with:

- 🧠 LLM-based taxonomy of smells and rule generation for configuration management tools  
- 🔐 Snyk-based vulnerability scanning automation  
- 📊 Dataset scraping and CI/CD integration (Jenkins) and Snyk analysis

---

## 🚀 Features

- **LLM-based Taxonomy of Security Smells**: Use of LLM to derive security smell categories from IaC smelly code snippets.
- **Rule Generation Automation**: Generate rules for tools like Ansible, Puppet, Saltstack, Chef, Vagrant, Pulumi, and Terraform using Python + LLMs.
- **Snyk Scanning**: Automate scanning of cloned repositories using Snyk CLI.
- **Data Pipeline**: Use Jenkins to manage and schedule scraping tasks.
- **Results Tracking**: Keep experiment outputs cleanly organized under `results/`.

- Python 3.x
- `snyk` CLI
- Jenkins (for CI tasks)
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `requests`, etc.
- API Key from GPT-3.5-turbo
